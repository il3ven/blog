I like to watch movies and T.V shows. Most of them are **non-mainstream**. I use this category to curate and recommend movies.

You can expect the movies to be English, some will be from various parts of India. There will be recent releases, old classics and hidden gems. My faviourite genres are: *Thriller, Comedy, Action, Sci-Fi, and Crime*.
