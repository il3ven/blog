Instant coffee is the worst tasting coffee. For 20 years of my life, the only coffee I knew was instant coffee.

Have you ever drank espresso (black coffee)? If you have ever drank espresso made from instant coffee, chances are that you found it too bitter to drink.

Coffee isn't supposed to be bitter.

Actual coffee is drinkable without any addition of milk. It isn't as bitter as instant coffee. Once you develop your taste, you will find hints of chocolate, nuts, hazlenuts, and caramel.

## What is instant coffee?

Unlike other coffees, instant coffee completely dissolves into the water. It also brews instantly.

## The Basics for a Good Cup of Coffee
Brewing a good cup of coffee is a science, but the taste is worth the effort.

For a good cup of coffee, first buy some good coffee beans and then extract the coffee from them. After extraction, we can add milk, sugar, or drink it plain.

### Methods for extracting coffee from beans

The complexity of the methods increases as you go down this list, but it's worth the extra effort.

1. **Coffee Dip Bags**: This is the simplest method. They are like tea bags and need to be dipped into hot water.
2. [**Channi Grind**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2O5MqXD4n0)

I have spared you the details from this post. The point is to throw away instant coffee and brew coffee using coffee beans.
