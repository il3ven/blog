Instant coffee is the worst tasting coffee. For 20 years of my life, the only coffee I knew was instant coffee.

Have you ever drank espresso (black coffee)? If you have drank espresso made from instant coffee chances are that you found it too bitter to drink.

Coffee isn't supposed to be bitter.

Actual coffee is drinkable without any addition of milk. It isn't as bitter as instant cofee. Once you develop your taste you can find hints of chocolate, nuts, hazlenut, and caramel.

### What is instant coffee?

Unlike other coffee, instant coffee completely disolves into the water. It also brews instantly.
