There has been a long gap between this list and the previous. That means, these movies have been filtered out from a large list of movies that I watched in this gap.

## Movies

### Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/portrait_on_fire.jpeg" width="500px">

It is a 2019 French historical romantic drama film. It's set in the 18th century and needs to be watched with subtitles. I am not a fan of romance but I am a fan of this movie. This movie is *emotional, romantic, beautiful, powerful and heartbreaking*.

### The Nice Guys (2016)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/nice-guys.jpeg" width="500px">

This movie has *action, detectives, and great comedy*. It's a killer combination that makes you feel good in the end. If you love *Hot Fuzz*, you will love this.

### The Other Guys (2010)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/other_guys.jpeg" width="500px">

Similar name to the previous one and similar feel too.

### The Big Lebowski (1998)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/lebowski.jpeg" width="500px">

This is a classic movie. It's dialogue has now become a part of pop culture. It has *comedy and crime*.

### Booksmart (2019)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/booksmart.jpeg" width="400px">

It's a movie about two booksmart best friends who on the last day of their high school try to have all the fun that they have missed. It's a coming of age comedy.

### Palm Springs (2020)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/palm_springs.jpeg" width="500px">

This movie is unique. It combines comedy and sci-fi. It stars one of my favorite actors, *Andy Sambergy* from Brooklyn Nine Nine. It's also short with a runtime of 90 mins.

### Almost Famous (2000)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/almost_famous.jpeg" width="500px">

Continuing with the same theme, this movie is a comedy and a coming-of-age that follows a 15 year old kid and a rock band. As a fan of rock music, I am a fan of this movie.

## Movies from India

This is a list of movies from India. It includes movies in Hindi, Malayalam, and Tamil.

### Super Deluxe (2019) (Tamil)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/super_deluxe.jpeg" width="500px">

It's a movie that starts as different storylines but converges into a single story. An unfaithful wife, an angry boy, and a transgender woman must all face their demons on one fateful day in a city of contradictions. 

### Kamayaab (2018) (Hindi)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/kamayaab.jpeg" width="500px">

This movie is set in Mumbai where a side actor about to retire retrospects his life. This movie stars Sanjay Mishra.

### The Great Indian Kitchen (2021) (Malayalam)

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/great_indian_kitchen.jpeg" width="500px">

Post her marriage, a woman tries to fit into the conventional mould that society has prescribed for married women. But somewhere along the way, she starts feeling that this is not the life she wants. The movie is 1hr and 40 mins of Patriarchy from different angles. The director has one point to make and he makes sure we all get it.

## T.V Shows

### Succession (2018 - )

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/succession.jpeg" width="500px">

The Logan family is known for controlling the biggest media and entertainment company in the world. However, their world changes when their father steps down from the company. The children fight for the succession of their father's company. These billionaires have lost touch with reality. 

The writing of the show is excellent, the actors are superb and the characters are extremely well written. It's a must watch.

### Ozark (2017 - )

<img src="../../../../images/movies/04/ozark.jpeg" width="500px">

This T.V show is often compared to Breaking Bad. It includes drugs, crime, money laundering and high stakes. The show is full of tension and drama that hooks you into the story. This year I really enjoyed watching season 4 of this show.
